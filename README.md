**OVERVIEW**

This repository was made for a Web Technologies Project by Chidiebele Benjamiin Amechi. The goal of the project is to create a RESTful API that retires user data with the help of Node JS, Express and Postman. During the process, I learned a lot about the fs module, the many uses of the terminal of VS code such as creating a repository and uploading files to it and also using it to install Express. 


**TEAM**

It was hard, amidst all the other projects piled on us but we pulled through and learned alot from it.
All this would not have been possible if not for the help of my team;

Bill Amegah - debugger and error fixing 

Maame Yaa Appiah- tester

Maame Araba Amoah - tester

Chidiebele Amechi - server creation

Michael Mortty -  server creation
and a very generous senior.
